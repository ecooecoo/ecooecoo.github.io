### Favorite Anime Shows

Over the years, I have watched a decent amount of anime. And while I generally prefer anime movies, a couple of shows have stood out to me as exceptional. 

I will be engaging with the plots of the shows but will try my best to refrain from revealing any major spoilers. It might be in your interest to watch the shows before reading about them if you prefer to watch shows without knowing their plot beforehand or holding any preconceived notions (I would personally recommend that you do this). 

### 1. Welcome to the N.H.K.

My all time favorite anime is Welcome to the N.H.K. I first watched Welcome to the N.H.K. sometime during my first or second year of college. That period of my life was emotionally difficult because I struggled to navigate the complex social world of college. I suffered from social anxiety which made it difficult to make friends and felt very lonely often in a depressive state. 

As with most media, the emotional impact of a show is strongly dependent on the psychological state of the consumer. Within the context of my social and emotional struggles it becomes pretty clear why I enjoyed the show so much. Satou served as a somewhat relatable protagonist who felt society had rejected him causing him to retreat into a reclusive lifestyle as a hikikomori. And magically, Misaki comes out of nowhere to save Satou from his hikikomori lifestyle and help him with his severe social anxiety. Maybe they will even develop feelings for each other! 

On the surface, it seems like the canonical Manic Pixie Dream Girl scenario. And I'm sure many viewers accepted the show for its surface level appearance and took home the idea that life is about passively waiting for someone else to come into it, especially in the context of dating. That's perfectly fine and I'm sure that Welcome to the N.H.K has influenced people in different ways. But for me, the show is emphatically not about waiting for your dream girl to magically appear. As the plot develops and the characters reveal their intentions, it becomes clear that the show is less about a perfect girl coming along to save a lonely boy and more about the complex traumas that influence how and why people form social connections. 

The show reveals that Misaki also suffers from trauma and has negative behavioral tendencies. She befriended Satou as a source of self reassurance, as confirmed when she reveals to Satou that she befriended him because of how pathetic he was. Satou lacked emotional maturity as a result of his severe social anxiety and lack of relationship experience. How they met and their friendship dynamic was imperfect and in many ways toxic. For me, Welcome to the N.H.K. is about how humans wants to feel worthy, how we want relationships with others, and how we struggle to navigate the social world. By the end of the show, Satou and Misaki have matured immensely. Satou begins to escape his hikikomori lifestyle and gets a job. Misaki, being a high school dropout, returns to school. Both are on the path to being able to navigate the social world with empathy. They have both developed a strong bond and treat each other with respect, shedding the toxic behaviors that they exhibited to each other. 

Upon reflection, I think that I enjoyed the show because of how visceral and directly relatable the themes were. The writer of the original story suffered from, and overcame, hikikomori. This probably made him especially apt to describing the emotional journey of overcoming conditions like the lack of self confidence, social anxiety, and depression. 

Welcome to the N.H.K.'s soundtrack is also incredibly moving. Two of my favorite songs, [Hitori no Tame no Lullaby](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DG_Yejl-0WM) and [Youkoso! Hitori Bocchi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ei2izPLpHc), are masterfully weaved into important moments so that they are unforgettable. Even now when I listen to them, I am sent into a strong catharsis that emotionally reminds me of how I felt back when I first watched the show. 

### 2. Ergo Proxy
