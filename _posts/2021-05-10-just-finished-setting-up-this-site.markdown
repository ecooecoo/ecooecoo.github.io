It's 3 AM and I have just finished setting up the basic structure of this website. I certainly plan on adding
more content in the future. 

Overall, I'm very glad with how the site turned out. Jekyll's default theme, "minima", is lovely and 
as minimalist as I was looking for. I plan on adding some more flare to it but I'm very satisfied with
the features that it offers. As I was searching
for a website generator, I wanted the one with the following criteria: static and having blogging capabilities. And,
of course, easy enough to use that someone like me could create one without too much struggle. 

I spent the most of this Sunday researching and working on publishing this website online. I have very little
experience with computer dealings, so I had to learn the basics of how GitHub works (this site runs on
free hosting through GitHub Pages), how to use the command prompt on Windows, and exploring the site settings
that I could modify within Jekyll. I still have a lot to learn and am excited to explore Jekyll's capabilities!
