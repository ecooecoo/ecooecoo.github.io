If you're looking to read a short children's book named "Chester the Birb: Just Another Day" that I wrote and illustrated, click [here](http://ecooecoo.com/chesterthebirb/).

Here's an interesting video about [the history of incels](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTMxRvoJXVc). And here's a [self portrait](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/531598247559692298/714393992430878750/IMG_3701.jpg) that I drew for an art class.

Happy Misaki Friday!
